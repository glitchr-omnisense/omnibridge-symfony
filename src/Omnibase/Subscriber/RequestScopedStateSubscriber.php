/**
 * Clears static state that is really request-scoped, for processes that outlive
 * a request: FrankenPHP worker mode and messenger consumers.
 *
 * Under FPM, or FrankenPHP classic mode, statics die with the request anyway and
 * both hooks below are no-ops on already-empty state.
 *
 * Two hooks, because neither covers every mode on its own:
 *
 *  - kernel.reset (reset()): the services_resetter runs between requests handled
 *    by the SAME kernel, and messenger resets services between messages. But
 *    under FRANKENPHP_RESET_KERNEL=1 the kernel is cloned after each request:
 *    Kernel::__clone() sets resetServices back to false and the clone boots a
 *    fresh container, so the resetter never runs at all - while class statics
 *    survive the clone untouched.
 *
 *  - kernel.request, main request only, top priority: fires in every mode,
 *    cloned kernel included, and ahead of LocalizerSubscriber (priority 8) and
 *    anything else that reads this state.
