/**
 * Records one Base\Service\Analytics::track() call per trackable request.
 * Runs on kernel.terminate (after the response has already been sent) so
 * the counter writes never add latency to what the visitor is waiting on.
 *
 * Not to be confused with the pre-existing Base\Subscriber\AnalyticsSubscriber
 * (an unrelated, currently-inert - gated behind the now-dead isAdmin()
 * check - "online users" heartbeat + Google Analytics live-stats puller).
 * That one is untouched by this; naming this class PageViewSubscriber
 * specifically to avoid colliding with it.
 *
 * "Trackable" is deliberately inferred from the RESPONSE rather than
 * matched against a path allow/deny list: a successful, GET, text/html
 * response is a real page render regardless of whether it arrived via a
 * normal navigation or one of transparentJS's AJAX SPA-swap fetches (both
 * return full HTML documents with that content type) - excluding XHR
 * requests outright would have undercounted most of this app's actual
 * navigation, since in-app browsing mostly happens through those swaps,
 * not full page loads. $excludedPrefixes is the one thing that IS
 * explicitly configured (bound in services.php) - keeps admin/API/asset
 * traffic out of what's meant to be public-site analytics.
